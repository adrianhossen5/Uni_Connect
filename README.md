This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```bash
'git clone https://github.com/adrianhossen5/COP4710_Term_Project' to clone the repo into your file directory.
'npm run i' to install all the dependencies
'npm run dev' to run the development server
'git pull' to pull all pending changes
'git commit -a -m "name of commit"' to commit your changes
'git push' to push your commits
```

## Extra:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result of 'npm run dev'.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
